Goal of project
Using xgboosting from Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm to learn the data from churn_modelling.csv and predicting the client will left 
the membership or not (yes=1 & No=0).
Tools or language used :
project is created using python 3. other modules used are sklearn, pandas, numpy,seaborn,matplotlib.
 
working in front end :
when a user enters the data of account holder in web application, data is sent to backend, predictions are done based on previoues learning 
  and returns prediction of client will left membership or not.
  
Working in back end:
 Data is fed to machince learing after performing Exploratory data analysis i.e. exploring data, understanding every feature, its use or relation with target,
  finding invalid values, replacing or making them null, filling or removing values based on their importance.
  data is sliptted into training and testing data which are then fed to machine to learn and also calulate their accuracy.
  based on that a model is created to predict the values enter by the user in web application.
  web application is linked to python and html through flask.
