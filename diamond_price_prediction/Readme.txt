Goal of project
Using random forest from Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm to learn the data from diamonds.csv and predicting the price of the diamond.
Tools or language used :
project is created using python 3. other modules used are sklearn, pandas, numpy,seaborn,matplotlib, pickle and flask.
 
working in front end :
when a user enters the data of the diamond in web application, data is sent to backend, predictions are done based on previous learning 
  and returns prediction of the price of the diamond.
  
Working in back end:
 Data is fed to machince learing after performing Exploratory data analysis i.e. exploring data, understanding every feature, its use or relation with target,
  performs EDA on dataset.
  data is sliptted into training and testing data which are then fed to machine to learn and also calulate their accuracy.
  based on that a model is created to predict the values enter by the user in web application.
  web application is linked to python and html through flask.
Note  : Please run the ipynb file before prediction on web page.
